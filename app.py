This web application uses my Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. The dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 categories, including vehicles and animals. Try it out by uploading an image!

# Offers guidance to users on the type of images that yield the best results,
# emphasizing the relevance to the CIFAR-10 dataset classes.
